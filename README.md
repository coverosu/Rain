This repo right here is an osu server written in py3.8! (3.9 soon)

I've wanted to make my own bancho server for a long time and so here is my second attempt

The purpose of this server was to make something unique like simulating bancho ranks and just have an osu server which is easy to setup for friends and tournements?

If your actually going for a server that wants to be an actual server like akatsuki, look into banchos like [gulag](https://github.com/cmyui/gulag) and [ruri](https://github.com/rumoi/ruri).

# TODO
```
Clean up score sub
Finish web and bancho handlers
At some point seprate web/ava/bancho handlers in different files
Add more protection to the server
Add some sort of anti cheat/multi account detection
Efficient bancho ranking simulation
Better docs for people who are newer to coding
Apply another language like Cython into the bancho in someway
```

# Motivations
I generally get motivated by banchos so i'll just list a couple here :D
